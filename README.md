Project description:

Gesture Controlled Car is a robot which can be controlled by simple human gestures.The user just needs to wear a gesture device in which a sensor is included. 
The sensor will record the movement of hand in a specific direction which will result in the motion of the robot in the respective directions. 
The robot and the Gesture instrument are connected wirelessly through radio waves. User can interact with the robot in a more friendly way due
to the wireless communication. We can control the car using accelerometer sensors connected to a hand glove. The sensors are intended to replace 
the remote control that is generally used to run the car. It will allow user to control the forward, backward, leftward and rightward movements, 
while using the same accelerometer sensor to control the throttle of the car. Movement of car is controlled by the differential mechanism. 
The main advantage of this mechanism is the car with this mechanism can take sharp turn without any difficulty.

The different gestures that have been mapped to the direction of the bot are:
Hand parallel to the ground-stationary
Hand tilted forward-forward
Hand tilted backward-backward
Hand tilted right-right
Hand tilted left-left
